#+title: npm workspaces experimentation/verification

Notes:
- All changes are committed, including =node_modules=. The purpose is to illustrate what really happens on each command.
- Each commit contains one command, or the reversal of the previous step and a command where a direct comparison is useful.
- Branches may exist containing alternative commands (for easier diffing)
